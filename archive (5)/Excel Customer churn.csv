1?? Overall Churn Rate

27% of all customers churned — a significant portion that affects long-term revenue.

2?? Billing Impact

Churned customers pay higher monthly charges (avg $74.44) compared to non-churned ($61.27).

This suggests price sensitivity and bill shock as major churn drivers.

3?? Internet Service Breakdown

Among customers who churned:

Fiber Optic: 69.4% of churn

DSL: 24.6%

No Internet: 6%

Interpretation:
"Fiber optic users churn the most despite being a premium service, likely due to higher monthly charges, performance expectations, or service dissatisfaction."

4?? Tenure Insights (Customer Lifetime)

Among churned users:

0–1 Year customers make up 53% of churn

Churn decreases sharply after Year 1 ? stronger retention after they stay longer.

Interpretation:
"New customers (first 12 months) are most vulnerable and should be prioritized for onboarding, support, and early-life retention offers."

5?? Contract Type

"Month-to-month customers dominate churn, matching the insight that flexible contracts equal low commitment."

Interpretation:
Encouraging 1–2 year contracts may significantly reduce churn.
